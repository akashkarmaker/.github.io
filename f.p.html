				<u>My Aim:
				</u>
			</h2>
		<p>
			<h3>I have big plans for my future.</br> I plan to make something of myself, and not to give up. I have a major fear of failure, and I won't let it get to me.</br> My parents expect a lot out of me, and I think I have done a good job so far. My dreams are what keep me going; they are an object for me to strive for.</br> I will obtain that object one day.</h3>
